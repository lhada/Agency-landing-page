# Agency landing page
These was a good training with inline,block and block-inline, all the website was building by pure HTML and CSS and without using any library plus without using flex, grid, mutli-column, or table-layout just positioning, margins, paddings, and the display property.\
Responsive for all devices using media queries.\
It was a design and I convert it to a code.\


# Why
Brief is just the website will be widely supported in all browser without any problem of compatibility,especially from IE 8 to the latest one.
And also using just margins and paddings, with the display property and positioning layout will optimize the speed as I thing by having a background on the rendering working proccess the other layout will make the browser make more complex calculations. 
And the latest is that I'm willing also to duplicate the project and named the copy one the min agency landing page, something like these, the difference is I will use a software or an extension while i search it, I think I will build one if i didn't find it, that clear all the spaces on the CSS file And the comments also and also for HTML( not all the espaces like between the words and the attributes from themselves and element also etc.), That will also affect the speed loading of the website as the length of files has her own affect in the network transfering speed. (the same for images).
